>If you're puzzled by some interaction with the server (often the case), it's a very good idea to set <CODE

>TDSDUMP</CODE

CLASS="COMMAND"
>gzip</B
> is also your friend here.  It's always a good idea to post it on a website where people can fetch it if they're so inclined.</P
><P
>Log files are especially important if you're not programming at the C level.  Sometimes there are problems &mdash; an impedance mismatch, to coin a phrase &mdash; between <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS</SPAN
> and the calling framework/language.  But if you write to the list and say <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Why does my <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PHP foo()</TT
> returns an empty string?"</SPAN
>, please keep in mind that your question might as well be in Urdu to someone familiar with the C library.  Without knowing which C function was called, and with what data, it's impossible to even begin to try to answer the question.  </P
><P
>Think about it this way: If you attach a log no one reads, you wasted some bandwidth.  If you don't attach one and someone asks you for it, you wasted a day.  Like that.</P

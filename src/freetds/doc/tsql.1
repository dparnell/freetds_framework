.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBtsql\fP is a diagnostic tool provided as part of FreeTDS. It uses the TDS
protocol directly to connect to Sybase or Microsoft SQL Servers, and allows
the user to issue queries that test the capabilities of FreeTDS. 
.PP
\fBtsql\fP is *not* a replacement for a complete isql, such as sqsh (www.sqsh.org). 
It is designed to rely on the lowest level FreeTDS library, tdslib, as a way to
isolate potential bugs in the protocol implementation. 
.PP
\fBtsql\fP can be run in two ways, one which uses the freetds.conf and one which
connects directly using the server's \fIhostname\fP and \fIport\fP. 
.PP
When \fB-S\fP is used, FreeTDS uses the freetds.conf (or equivalent) and environment
variables in the normal way to determine the server's ip address and \fIport\fP. You
can use \fB-I\fP to specify a filename, overriding FreeTDS's configuration file
search algorithm. 
.PP
The \fB-H\fP and \fB-p\fP parameters are provided especially for troubleshooting new
configurations (or servers). Use of these parameters causes FreeTDS to ignore
any freetds.conf and environment variables.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B
\fB-S\fP \fIservername\fP
the Database Server to which to connect.
.TP
.B
\fB-I\fP \fIinterface\fP
a freetds.conf or interfaces file describing \fIservername\fP
.TP
.B
\fB-H\fP \fIhostname\fP
the DNS \fIhostname\fP of the server
.TP
.B
\fB-p\fP \fIport\fP
the \fIport\fP at which SQL Server is listening
.TP
.B
\fB-U\fP \fIusername\fP
database login name. If \fIusername\fP is not provided, a domain
login is attempted for TDS 7+ connections.
.TP
.B
\fB-P\fP \fIpassword\fP
database \fIpassword\fP.
.PP
\fB-L\fP list server "instances" (with \fB-H\fP)
.TP
.B
\fB-C\fP
prints some of the compile-time configuration parameters.  
.TP
.B
\fB-o\fP \fIoptions\fP
apply the \fIoptions\fP specified to every command.

.SH NOTES

Typing "exit", "quit", or "bye" (or ^D) exits \fBtsql\fP. 
.PP
Typing "version" displays the TDS protocol version. 
.PP
Command batches may be separated with "go" or "GO". If "GO", the version
string is reported before executing the batch. 
.PP
After prompting for the \fIpassword\fP, \fBtsql\fP will attempt to connect to the remote
.TP
.B
server.
\fBtsql\fP displays a counter indicating the number of seconds that
.TP
.B
it is attempting to connect.
Typically, \fBtsql\fP should immediately respond
.TP
.B
with a '1>' prompt.
If you see the counter (1, 2, 3, \.\.\.), most likely \fBtsql\fP
is unable to connect to the indicated server.
.PP
If you can connect with "\fBtsql\fP \fB-S\fP \fIservername\fP", your basic FreeTDS installation
is working. 
.PP
If you have suggestions for ways to make \fBtsql\fP more useful as a diagnostic tool,
please recommend them to the FreeTDS mailing list for consideration.
